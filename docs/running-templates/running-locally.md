# Run locally (directly on your machine)

This option lets you run a RECAP template directly on your own computer, using software installed locally.

Compared to GitHub Codespaces or an isolated environment, this option requires the least abstraction, but places more responsibility on your local setup.

It is best suited for small projects, quick experimentation, or users who are already comfortable managing their own software environment.

---

## When this option is a good fit

Choose this option if:
- you are comfortable installing and managing software on your machine,
- you want full control over the execution environment,
- you are working on a small or short-lived project,
- you prefer not to rely on containers or cloud services.

---

## How it works

The template is run directly using software installed on your computer.

You download the project files, open them locally, and follow the instructions provided in the template to run the analysis and produce outputs.

Unlike other options, no additional environment is created: the results depend entirely on the tools and versions available on your system.

## Get the project files

On the template’s GitHub repository page, choose how you want to get the project files:

- **I don’t want to use Git**  
  Click **Code → Download ZIP**, extract the archive on your computer, then open the extracted folder in your editor.

- **I want to use Git**  
  Click the **“Use this template”** button to create your own repository under your GitHub account, then clone it locally.

  Using Git is optional, but makes it easier to track changes, revert experiments (including large changes generated by AI assistants), and collaborate with others.

  If you would like a gentle introduction focused on the RECAP workflow, see  
  **[How to get started with Git](/docs/version-control)**.

## Required software

RECAP templates rely on a number of tools, such as:
- a statistical programming language (for example, R),
- document generation tools,
- and basic build utilities.

The exact requirements depend on the template size.

In particular, **Medium and Large templates require a richer software stack** than the Small template, which may involve installing and configuring multiple tools manually.

---

## Things to be aware of

- **Setup effort increases with project size**  
  Installing and maintaining all required tools can take time, especially for larger templates.

- **Reproducibility depends on your local setup**  
  Results may vary across machines due to differences in software versions or system configuration.

If you encounter setup issues or want stronger guarantees of reproducibility, consider running the template in an [isolated local environment](/docs/running-templates/running-docker.md) or [in the cloud using GitHub Codespaces](/docs/running-templates/github-codespaces.md).
