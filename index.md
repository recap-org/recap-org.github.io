# Reproducible research made easy
{: .fs-9 }

RECAP helps social scientists start projects with fully reproducible, ready-to-use research environments.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

RECAP (Reproducible Environments for Collaborative Academic Projects) generates starter templates for common academic use cases — from assignments to full-blown research papers.

Our templates promote good research practices that enable effective workflows and are key to reproducibility. These practices include [version control](/docs/version-control), built-in [dependency management](/docs/dependency-management), and automated [build pipelines](/docs/build). 

Each template provides a complete, [containerized environment](/docs/containers), ensuring that the analysis can be replicated, that all collaborators share the exact same software, and that templates can not only be used locally with popular IDEs such as VS Code or RStudio, but also opened directly in the cloud (e.g., GitHub Codespaces).

# Getting started

## Choose your template

- Small 
  - A single file that runs an analysis and produces a reproducible report
  - For: homework and short assignments
- Medium 
  - A structured workflow with separate cleaning and analysis steps, producing a final report
  - For: final project
- Large
  - A full research pipeline with multiple scripts and deliverables (paper, appendix, slides)
  - For: thesis and long-term collaborative research 

## Choose your language
